This folder contains files used to implement a 12x12 bit multiplier following the heirarchical approach where a 3x3 muliplier is used to create 6x6 multiplier which in turn is used to finally write the 12x12 bit multiplier module.
The testbench to simulate and verify corner cases is also uploaded along with the design files.
