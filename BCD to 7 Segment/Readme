This folder contains all the files related to BCD to 7 segment display project.
1) The verilog module here is written to convert 4 bit BCD numbers (0-9) into 7 segment displays. 
2) The development board used is Spartan-7 FPGA development kit provided by Invent logics. 
3) The input number to be given is governed by switches SW3, SW2, SW1 and SW0 with the SW3 being the MSB and SW0 being the LSB.
4) For all values greater than 9, nothing will be displayed on the 7 segment display. 
5) There are 4 digits present on the board and the code includes handling the selection of these digits using the switches SW15, SW14, SW13 and SW12 in order from leftmost to rightmost respectively.
